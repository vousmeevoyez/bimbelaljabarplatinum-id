# Authentication Guidelines

## Authentication Stack

The authentication logic is in `src/utils/auth.ts` and `src/utils/kv-session.ts` and is based on Lucia Auth.

## Server Components

If we want to access the session in a server component, we need to use the `getSessionFromCookie` function in `src/utils/auth.ts`.

## Client Components

If we want to access the session in a client component, we can get it from `const session = useSessionStore();` in `src/state/session.ts`.
