# TypeScript Usage

## Type Definitions

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use declarative JSX.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
