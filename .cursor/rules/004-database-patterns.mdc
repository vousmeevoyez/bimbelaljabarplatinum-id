# Database Patterns

The database schema is in `src/db/schema.ts`.

## Drizzle ORM Guidelines

- Never use Drizzle ORM Transactions since Cloudflare D1 doesn't support them.
- When inserting or updating items with Drizzle ORM never pass an id since we autogenerate it in the schema.
- When using `db.insert().values()` never pass and id because we autogenerate them.

## Migration Workflow

Never generate SQL migration files. Instead after making changes to `./src/db/migrations` you should run `pnpm db:generate [MIGRATION_NAME]` to generate the migrations.
